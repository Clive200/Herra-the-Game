# Herra is a 2D platformer game made in Unity Engine.

# I have always been inspired by animation and game development, so I took this opportunity to try my 2D platformer game.

# The game is running locally. I have not yet completed it because I was pacing myself to learn as I wrote the code. I also encountered a lot of bugs.

# Everything I tried worked, but I had to find alternative methods to do some tasks since I was using a different version of Unity than the one used in my tutorial. For instance, Cinemachine works a little bit differently in newer versions than the one I was using.

# I plan to finish this game, then create my own from scratch without a tutorial.
